While it covers most areas of the world, within that it also shows a broader idea of what human built-up and settlement looked like in the US. Additionally, the time frame of this data looks at the year 2010 which is within the time frames of this project. If we could find a similar map to this for 2020, this could be a good comparison to how human development has changed and what impact it has had on biodiversity. Lastly, as I previously mentioned, the data is at a scale that gives the broad idea of what has occured in the world as far as human development, which would be helpful in seeing the bigger picture in the US. </mark>"
