A feature dataset is a collection of spatial data, such as data layers and other geometric constructs. Multiple feature datasets can reside in a geodatabase. When you hold clusters of these feature datasets together you have layers called feature classes. To summarize the relationship of these three words, geodatabases hold feature datasets while feature datasets hold feature classes.\n",
